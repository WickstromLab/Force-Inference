# Force-Inference for epithelial cells

`@Author: Ali Hashmi`

see my Wolfram Community post for more information: https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1571507

This is a Mathematica implementation of the `Bayesian Force Inference` technique by Ishihara and Sugimura (Journal of Theoretical Biology, 2012). The script files/notebooks  located in the  `main` folder will infer tension for edges between epithelial cells and the pressure within the cells. The input is a binarized image of an epithelia.

##### Please note that the borders of the image used below, `image.tif` (inside 'for ReadMe' folder), have pixels that are filled.
