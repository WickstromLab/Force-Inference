# Force-Inference for epithelial cells

This is a Mathematica implementation of the `Bayesian Force Inference` technique by Ishihara and Sugimura (Journal of Theoretical Biology, 2012). The script file `Force Inference.m` will infer tension between epithelial cells and the pressure within the cells by using a binarized image of an epithelia.

###### Note: the notebook (.nb file) contains the same code as the script file. The only difference is that I have included some auxiliary parts in the notebook to check the robustness of detection of vertices and some visualizations to ensure the implementation is fool-proof. The extra results are included in `robustness check.pdf`
